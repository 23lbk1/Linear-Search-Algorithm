# Linear-Search-Algorithm
The project I have chosen to do is a linear search algorithm. Linear search algorithms provide a clear and intuitive way to demonstrate how searching algorithms operate at a fundamental level. Linear search makes every comparison step explicit, which is perfect for an educational, interactive visualization. The user can directly see how the algorithm scans through a list, evaluates each element, and how it determines whether the target value is found.

Another reason I have for selecting linear search is that it works on any type of dataset without requiring pre-processing, unlike algorithms that need specific structures. This allows users to enter any list of numbers and immediately test how the algorithm behaves.

From a computational thinking perspective, linear search is a perect example for illustrating decomposition and pattern recognition. Its repetitive comparison pattern is easy to connect to broader computing strategies, and its straightforward control flow helps show how input > processing > output are structured in algorithm design.
